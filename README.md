# Disclaimer about Owenership

## Code Owenership

Some parts of this Project have been made by [heisenbergpxh](https://github.com/heisenbergpxh).
Sadly they cut contact with me during development of this Project, therefore I had to complete this project on my own. 
As the original Repository was owned by them and I wasn't able to reach them, this Repository was created so I could make some necessary changes
